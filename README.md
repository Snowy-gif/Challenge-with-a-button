# Challenge-with-a-button
This app was created using Python with the tkinter module and random, along with a few other modules. You click on the button, and it gives you a task, but if you fail it, then the app will tell the CPU a critical error has happened and will blue screen the computer.
Please do not use this to prank people in ANY WAY.
